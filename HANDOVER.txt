The Other Side { Do Tawley Meats as clean and fresh, Nora's Flat as the same but different, both locations to be flipped horizontally }

Space { Nora escapes ROARK in a small ship before Tesseract Implosion.  
		Nora tries 'compact tesseract' but realises 'location in space' matters, flies back to site of entry and tries again.
		Due to having already used tesseract once, erroneously, it had not enough power for the whole journey.
		Nora is shit out near the International Space Station and must hitch a ride on a supply capsule.
		Nora must open the hatch and climb inside or she is toast.
		Nora should have lots of photos, enough for a career change.
		etc
