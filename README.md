W.H.I.T aims to be a first person investigative mystery game.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You assume the role of Nora Kennedy, a struggling reporter working for a small town newspaper who dreams of becoming a broadcast news anchor, like Walter Cronkite, but feels hemmed in by her editor.

One morning, you are awoken by a phone call from a man known only as "Kieron".

Kieron's daughter is the latest in a string of unexplained disappearances in the town of Tawley, County Leitrim.

The Garda√≠ are fobbing him off and after months, he's at the end of his tether.  He saw one of your fluff pieces buried in the centre pages and thinks you might be able to help each other; you track down his daughter and then you get to run the story that gets you off Page 30 and into the nationals - a step closer to your dreams.

You soon find you've bitten off more than you bargained for, and with nothing more than your smart phone and torch for protection you must explore bleak environments to gather evidence and blow the lid off a scandal with interdimensional ramifications.

That's just the way it is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

W.H.I.T is a one-man-band production and as such, probably won't be a finished game in the world for a while.

Demo? No demo soz.
